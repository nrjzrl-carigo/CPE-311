    "**Storing Data in SQLite:**  \r\n",
    "I discovered how to save a Pandas DataFrame into an SQLite database. It was a great learning experience because I now understand how to store data in a structured and easily accessible format.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Data Manipulation Language (DML):**  \r\n",
    "I practiced using DML commands to modify and organize data within a database. Although it was a bit confusing at first, I eventually got the hang of it. This skill will be really useful when I need to clean or update data for analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Aggregating Data:**  \r\n",
    "I explored how to use aggregation functions in Pandas to compute statistics like averages, minimums, and maximums all at once.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Grouping Data:**  \r\n",
    "I also learned how to use the `groupby` function to categorize data and apply different calculations to each group. For instance, I can group weather data by station and easily find the average temperature or total rainfall for each location.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Handling Time-Based Data:**  \r\n",
    "Working with date and time data (not just dates) was one of the tougher parts. I used functions like `between_time` and `at_time` to filter data by specific hours or time intervals. This opened up the possibility of analyzing data on an hourly level, which was a big step forward for me.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Storing, Manipulating, and Analyzing Data:**  \r\n",
    "Overall, I feel much more capable when it comes to storing, managing, and analyzing data. Being able to handle time-based data in particular has made a huge difference in what I can do.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Challenges with Newer Pandas Versions:**  \r\n",
    "Of course, not everything went smoothly. Some older code didn’t work with the latest version of Pandas. I ran into warnings about deprecated functions like `last()` and `first()`, so I had to figure out their replacements. It was a bit frustrating, but in the end, it was a good reminder to keep up with chang, technical, or reflective!"

    "Using the CSV files provided and what we have learned so far in this module complete the following exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With the earthquakes.csv file, select all the earthquakes in Japan with a magType of mb and a magnitude of 4.9 or greater.\r\n",
    "2. Create bins for each full number of magnitude (for example, the first bin is 0-1, the second is 1-2, and so on) with a magType of ml and count how many are in each bin.\r\n",
    "3. Using the faang.csv file, group by the ticker and resample to monthly frequency. Make the following aggregation\n",
    "   > Mean of the opening price\n",
    "   > \n",
    "   > Maximum of the high price\n",
    "   > \n",
    "   > Minimum of the low price\n",
    "   > \n",
    "   > Mean of the closing price\n",
    "   > \n",
    "   > Sum of the volume traded\n",
    "   > \n",
    "4. Build a crosstab with the earthquake data between the tsunami column and the magType column. Rather than showing the frequency count, show the maximum\r\n",
    "magnitude that was observed for each combination. Put the magType along the columns.\r\n",
    "5. Calculate the rolling 60-day aggregations of OHLC data by ticker for the FAANG data. Use the same aggregations as exercise no. 3.\r\n",
    "6. Create a pivot table of the FAANG data that compares the stocks. Put the ticker in the rows and show the averages of the OHLC and volume traded data.\r\n",
    "7. Calculate the Z-scores for each numeric column of Netflix's data (ticker is NFLX) using apply().\r\n",
    "8. Add event descript\n",
    "   > Create a dataframe with the following three columns: ticker, date, and event. The columns should have the following values:\n",
    "   >  > ticker: 'FB'\n",
    "   >  > \n",
    "   >  > date: ['2018-07-25', '2018-03-19', '2018-03-20']\n",
    "   >  > \n",
    "   >  > event: ['Disappointing user growth announced after close.', 'Cambridge Analytica story', 'FTC investigation']\n",
    "   >  > \n",
    "   > Set the index to ['date', 'ticker']\n",
    "   > \n",
    "   > Merge this data with the FAANG data using an outer join\n",
    "9. Use the transform() method on the FAANG data to represent all the values in terms of the first date in the data. To do so, divide all the values for each ticker by the values\r\n",
    "for the first date in the data for that ticker. This is referred to as an index, and the data for the first date is the base (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/\r\n",
    "index.php/ Beginners:Statisticalconcept-Indexandbaseyear). When data is in this format, we can easily see growth over time. Hint: transform() can take a function name.ions:s:"
